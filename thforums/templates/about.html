        The (Mostly True) Legend of Tavernhold

Long ago—like, really long ago, probably before breakfast—there existed a magical inn that wasn’t nailed to the ground. Known as Tavernhold, it roamed the realms on invisible chicken legs (don’t ask), popping up wherever adventurers needed a place to argue loudly, swap wild tales, or recover from being set on fire again.

But as magic shifted and the age of enchanted scrolls gave way to the mysterious powers of the Etherweb, Tavernhold transformed into something stranger: an ethereal tavern-forum floating in the endless void of the Interrealms—a place where wizards mistype incantations into message boards, bards spam their mixtapes in every thread, and at least one rogue is always trying to sell you cursed gear “at a great price, no hexes, promise.”

Here, new adventurers arrive daily, usually looking for fame, glory, or directions to the bathroom. Veterans lounge by the digital hearth, regaling newcomers with stories that definitely didn’t happen that way. You’ll find paladins debating sword polish techniques, necromancers arguing about ethical undead labor, and a goblin-only cooking channel that’s surprisingly wholesome.

Need a party for your next dungeon crawl? Looking to unload that +2 banana of Bantering? Just want to shout into the void about how the Mimic ate your boots again? Tavernhold has a thread for that.

It's chaos. It’s community. It’s... probably on fire again.

So grab a tankard (or keyboard), pull up a virtual chair made entirely of eldritch wood and bad decisions, and join the ever-growing chorus of misfits, heroes, and loot-greedy lunatics. Because in Tavernhold, everyone’s got a tale to tell—and nobody's checking for truth rolls.
